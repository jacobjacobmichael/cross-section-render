# cross-section-render
Tool for transforming point cloud into a series of 2D cross sections

So I had this vision for creating "3-D coloring books" where you find a 3D model of something (like a pokemon, or a portrait, or whatever), 
you run it through this program, it generates a series of cross-sections that you fill in with hot glue or something, you stack the cross-sections atop
one another, and viola, you have a hand made 3D model of something.

I realized, however, that this was a horrible idea, so I scrapped it. But the code was fun to write! :D
